 <h2> About </h2>
 <hr>
  This project part of the "Object Oriented Programming in Java" course
 offered by UC San Diego through Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/). 

  I got a skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse as well as some starter
 code for the programming assignments associated with the MOOC.

  It's must be very interesting, work on this project, so I decide
 use git too.
